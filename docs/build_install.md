# Quick start
 
## Quick start with Intel SGX
Ensure your system have installed sgx driver, sgx sdk and sgx psw. You can install by [released version](https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads) or [linux-sgx](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx) source code.
1. Clone the secGear repository:

```
git clone https://gitee.com/openeuler/secGear.git
```
2. Build secGear and examples

```
cd secGear
source /opt/intel/sgxsdk/environment && source environment
mkdir debug && cd debug && cmake ..&& make && sudo make install
```
3. Run Helloworld

```
./examples/helloworld/host/secgear_helloworld
```
4. For more complex examples, see `examples` directory.

## Quick start with ARM TrustZone(Kunpeng itrustee)
Now, itrustee TeeOS is only flashed on Kunpeng(such as Kunpeng 920).</br>
Ensure your system have installed ocaml-dune, if installed ignore this step.
Otherwise install refer to [ocaml-dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune)

1. Clone the secGear repository:
```
git clone https://gitee.com/openeuler/secGear.git
```
2. Build secGear and examples
```
cd secGear
source environment
mkdir debug && cd debug && cmake -DENCLAVE=GP ..&& make && sudo make install
```
3. Run Helloworld
```
/vendor/bin/secgear_helloworld
```
4. For more complex examples, see `examples` directory.

## Build with RSIC-V Penglai
refer to [riscv_tee.md](./riscv_tee.md)

## Note
The build cmd `cmake ..` used default sdk installed path and default enclave ssl installed path(optional, only need when your application uses libssl).
If you install them by customize, you need input your customize path by cmake such asï¼š

```
// the following two cmd is same
cmake .. 
cmake -DSDK_PATH=/opt/intel/sgxsdk -DSSL_PATH=/opt/intel/sgxssl ..

// input your customize path
cmake -DSDK_PATH="sdk installed path" -DSSL_PATH="enclave ssl installed path" ..
```
